# Higher order Components

# Exercises

## Exercises: Level 1

### 1. What is higher order function

A **higher-order function** is a function that takes another function as an argument, or returns a function as a result.

### 2. What is Higher Order Component

In React, a **higher-order component (HOC)** is an advanced technique for reusing component logic. A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

The idea behind higher-order components is to share common functionality between components without repeating code. A higher-order component can be used to enhance a component with extra functionality.
For example, a HOC can be used to add authentication to a component.
Another example is to use a HOC to add a loading spinner to a component.

### 3. What is the difference between higher order function and higher order component?

Here is a comparison table between higher-order functions and higher-order components in React:

| Higher-Order Function                                          | Higher-Order Component                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A function that takes in a function and returns a new function | A function that takes in a component and returns a new component with additional functionality |
| Used to create a higher-order component                        | Used to create a higher-order component                                                        |
| Can be used to share functionality between components          | Can be used to share functionality between components                                          |
| Can be used to create reusable logic                           | Can be used to create reusable logic                                                           |
| Can be used to create a custom hook                            | Can be used to create a custom hook                                                            |
| Can be used to create a render prop                            | Can be used to create a render prop                                                            |
